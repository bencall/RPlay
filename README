What it is
----------
This program is in alpha version.
It emulates an Airport Express for the purpose of streaming music from iTunes and compatible iPods. It implements a server for the Apple RAOP protocol.

Installation
------------
Double clicking on RPlay.jar in the binaries folder should be enough...
